INSERT INTO `blood_pressure` VALUES('BLP1','Clonodine-.1mg','CLONODINE HCL-.1 Tablets','Why is this medication prescribed? Clonidine is used to treat high blood pressure. It works by decreasing your heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. 

How should this medicine be used? Clonidine comes as a tablet to take by mouth and a patch to apply to the skin. The tablet usually is taken two or three times a day at evenly spaced intervals. The patch is applied to the skin every 7 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clonidine exactly as directed.

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you are using the clonidine patch, ask your doctor or pharmacist for the manufacturer''s patient instructions and read them carefully. To apply the patch, follow these directions: 
Clean a relatively hairless area of unbroken skin on your upper arm or chest with mild soap and water and dry it completely. Peel the clear plastic strip from the adhesive side of a patch. 
Attach the patch to your skin by placing the adhesive side against it and pressing firmly. Place an overlay patch provided with your prescription over the top of the patch to secure it. If the patch loosens before replacement time, place adhesive tape or an overlay patch over the top of the patch to secure it. If the skin under the patch becomes irritated, remove the patch and replace it with a new one in a different area. Fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides together and dispose of it carefully. The patch still contains active medication that could be harmful to children or pets. Always be sure to remove the old patch before applying another one.


Clonidine controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take clonidine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking clonidine without talking to your doctor. Do not stop taking clonidine suddenly, that can cause a rise in blood pressure and symptoms such as nervousness, headache, and confusion. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over a few days.

Clonidine is also used in the treatment of Tourette''s syndrome, migraine headaches, ulcerative colitis, menopausal hot flashes, alcohol withdrawal, and as an aid in smoking cessation therapy. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this drug for your condition.

What special precautions should I follow? Before taking clonidine, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to clonidine or any other drugs. tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially amitriptyline (Elavil); beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), carteolol (Cartrol), labetalol (Normodyne, Trandate), metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol (Corgard), propranolol (Inderal), sotalol (Betapace), and timolol (Blocadren); clomipramine (Anafranil); desipramine (Norpramin); doxepin (Adepin, Sinequan); imipramine (Tofranil); nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor); protriptyline (Vivactil); sleeping pills; trimipramine (Surmontil); and vitamins. tell your doctor if you have or have ever had coronary artery disease, kidney disease, or a heart attack. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking clonidine, call your doctor. If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking clonidine. you should know that this drug may make you drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this drug affects you. Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are using clonidine. Alcohol can make the side effects from clonidine worse. 

What special dietary instructions should I follow? Your doctor may prescribe a low-salt or low-sodium diet. Follow these directions carefully.

What should I do if I forget a dose? Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. 

What side effects can this medication cause? Clonidine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: 
dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, tiredness, headache, nervousness, decreased sexual ability, upset stomach, vomiting, rash.

If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: 
fainting, increased or decreased heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, swollen ankles or feet

INSERT INTO `blood_pressure` VALUES('BLT4','Lopid-300','Gemfibrozil-300','High cholesterol and lipid levels Gemfibrozil How does it work? This medicine contains the active ingredient gemfibrozil, which is a type of medicine known as a fibrate. It works by reducing the production of fats (lipids) by the liver. These lipids include cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is one of the body''s fats (lipids). Cholesterol and triglycerides are important building blocks in the structure of cells and are also used in making hormones and producing energy. To some extent, the cholesterol level in blood depends on what you eat but it is mainly dependent on how the body makes cholesterol in the liver. Having too much cholesterol in the blood is not a disease in itself, but can lead to the hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). For the sake of simplicity, there are two sorts of cholesterol; a ''bad'' sort called low density lipoprotein (LDL) and a ''good'' sort called high density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL is deposited in the arteries and increases the risk of heart disease, while HDL actually protects the arteries against this. Triglycerides can also be considered as ''bad'' fats; they also contribute to the risk of heart disease. Gemfibrozil increases the breakdown of triglycerides already present in the body. It also decreases the production of triglycerides by the liver. This lowers triglyceride levels. Gemfibrozil lowers LDL cholesterol by increasing the amount which is expelled from the gall bladder in the bile. In addition, it increases the levels of HDL cholesterol. The overall result of this is lowered levels of "bad fats" and raised levels of "good fats". Fibrates have an important role in the prevention of heart disease. They reduce the risk of fats being deposited in the major blood vessels of the heart. Any blockage in the blood vessels limits the amount of blood and therefore oxygen being carried to the heart muscle. In severe cases this can result in a heart attack (myocardial infarction). This medicine is only used when blood lipid levels cannot be lowered by diet and exercise alone. It is important to follow a diet and exercise regime when taking gemfibrozil.');

Fat (also known as lipid), is one of the three classes of nutrients; the other two are proteins and carbohydrates. The major function of fat is to provide energy for the body. Pound per pound, fat contains more energy (calories) than protein and carbohydrates. There are three types of fat: triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Triglycerides are where most of the fat calories are stored. In addition to providing energy, fat also serves other functions, for example, cholesterol and phospholipids are components of cell membranes and sheaths surrounding nerve cells. Cholesterol is also important for the production of bile acids and other hormones (such as sex hormones and adrenal hormones). 

What are fatty acids? Fatty acids consist of chains of carbon atoms linked together by chemical bonds. On one end (terminal) of the carbon chain is a methyl group (a cluster of carbon and hydrogen atoms), the other terminal is a carboxyl group (a cluster of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms). The chemical bonds between carbon atoms can be either single or double bonds. Single bonds have more hydrogen molecules around them than double bonds. These chemical bonds determine whether a fatty acid is saturated or unsaturated (see discussion below). Fatty acids also come in different lengths: short chain fatty acids have less than 6 carbons, while long chain fatty acids have 12 or more carbons. 

Fatty acids serve as energy for the muscles, heart, and other organs, as building blocks for cell membranes, and as energy storage for the body. Those fatty acids not used up as energy are converted into triglycerides. A triglyceride is a molecule formed by attaching three fatty acids onto a glycerol compound that serves as a backbone. Triglycerides are then stored in the body as fat (adipose) tissue. 

What are saturated fatty acids? Saturated fatty acids contain single bonds only. Fats containing saturated fatty acids are called saturated fats. Examples of foods high in saturated fats include lard, butter, whole milk, cream, eggs, red meat, chocolate, and solid shortenings. Excess intake of saturated fat can raise one''s blood cholesterol and increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease. 

What are monounsaturated fatty acids? Monounsaturated fatty acids contain one double bond. Examples of foods high in monounsaturated fat include avocados, nuts, and olive, peanut and canola oils. Scientists believe that increased consumption of monounsaturated fats (for example eating more nuts) is beneficial in lowering LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) and lowering the risk of coronary heart disease, especially if monounsaturated fats are used to substitute for saturated fats and refined sugars.

What are polyunsaturated fatty acids? Polyunsaturated fatty acids contain more than one double bond. Examples of foods high in polyunsaturated fats include vegetable oils, corn, sunflower, and soy.

What are essential fatty acids? Essential fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids that the human body needs for metabolic functioning but cannot produce, and therefore has to be acquired from food. 

What are omega-3 fatty acids? Omega-3 fatty acids are a class of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids with the double bond in the third carbon position from the methyl terminal (hence the use of "3" in their description). Foods high in omega-3-fatty acids include salmon, halibut, sardines, albacore, trout, herring, walnut, flaxseed oil, and canola oil. Other foods that contain omega-3-fatty acids include shrimp, clams, light chunk tuna, catfish, cod, and spinach.

What are omega-6 fatty acids? Omega-6 fatty acids are a class of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids with the initial double bond in the sixth carbon position from the methyl group (hence the "6"). Examples of foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids include corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and cottonseed oil. 

What are the n-3 and n-6 fatty acids? These are synonyms for omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, respectively. 

What are trans fatty acids? Trans fatty acids (trans fats) are made through hydrogenation to solidify liquid oils. Heating omega-6 oils such as corn oil to high temperatures creates trans fats. Trans fats increase the shelf life of oils and are found in vegetable shortenings and in some margarines, commercial pastries, fried foods, crackers, cookies, and snack foods. Intake of trans fatty acids increases blood LDL-cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol), decreases HDL cholesterol ("good cholesterol"), and raises the risk of coronary heart disease.

INSERT INTO `blood_pressure` VALUES('CHO5','Zetia-10','Ezetimibe-10','GENERIC NAME: Ezetimibe BRAND NAME: Zetia DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: 

Ezetimibe is a drug that is used for the treatment of elevated levels of blood cholesterol. The most commonly used class of drugs for lowering cholesterol levels, the statins, act by preventing the production of cholesterol by the liver. Ezetimibe has a different mechanism of action and lowers blood cholesterol by reducing the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine. It does not affect the absorption of triglycerides or fat-soluble vitamins. Ezetimibe was approved by the FDA in October, 2002. 

PRESCRIPTION: Yes 

STORAGE: Ezetimibe tablets should be stored at room temperature, 59-86°F (15-30°C). 

PRESCRIBED FOR: Ezetimibe is used to reduce LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) concentrations in the blood. It is estimated that 60% of the 13 million patients who are already taking drugs (primarily statins) for elevated levels of cholesterol continue to have levels of LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) that are higher than recommended levels. These patients may need to take an additional drug to bring levels of cholesterol down to recommended levels. Ezetimibe can be used together with the statins such as lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), or rosuvastatin (Crestor) to further lower the levels of cholesterol. 

DOSING: The recommended dose of ezetimibe is 10 mg daily. Ezetimibe can be taken with or without food and at the same time as statin drugs. 

DRUG INTERACTIONS: Cholestyramine (Questran), colestipol (Colestid) and colesevelam (WelChol), bile acid-binding drugs that may be used to treat elevated levels of cholesterol, bind to ezetimibe and reduce its absorption from the intestine by about 50%. Therefore, ezetimibe should be taken at least two hours after or one hour before these drugs. Cyclosporin increases the levels of ezetimibe and could lead to greater side effects of ezetimibe. 

PREGNANCY: There are no adequate studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women. Therefore, physicians must weight the benefit of prescribing ezetimibe during pregnancy against the potential but unknown risks. 

NURSING MOTHERS: There are no adequate studies of ezetimibe in nursing women. Therefore, physicians must weight the benefit of prescribing ezetimibe to nursing women against the potential and unknown risks. 

SIDE EFFECTS: Ezetimibe is well-tolerated. The overall rate of side effects with ezetimibe in clinical studies was similar to that reported with placebo (an inactive sugar pill). Diarrhea, abdominal pain, back pain, joint pain, and sinusitis were the most commonly reported side effects, occurring in 1 in every 25 to 30 patients. Rarely, hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema (swelling of the skin and underlying tissues of the head and neck that can be life-threatening) and skin rash. Pancreatitis and nausea may occur. Muscle damage (myopathy or rhabdomyolysis) and hepatitis have rarely been associated with the use of ezetimibe.');

Maintenance therapy prevents or diminishes the intensity of subsequent episodes in those manic-depressive patients with a history of mania. 

Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, elation, poor judgment, aggressiveness and possibly hostility. When given to a patient experiencing a manic episode, ESKALITH may produce a normalization of symptomatology within 1 to 3 weeks. 

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Immediate-release capsules are usually given t.i.d. or q.i.d. Doses of controlled-release tablets are usually given b.i.d. (approximately 12-hour intervals). When initiating therapy with immediate-release or controlled-release lithium, dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. When switching a patient from immediate-release capsules to ESKALITH CR Controlled-Release Tablets, give the same total daily dose when possible. Most patients on maintenance therapy are stabilized on 900 mg daily, e.g., ESKALITH CR 450 mg b.i.d. When the previous dosage of immediate-release lithium is not a multiple of 450 mg, e.g., 1,500 mg, initiate ESKALITH CR at the multiple of 450 mg nearest to, but below, the original daily dose, i.e., 1,350 mg. 

When the 2 doses are unequal, give the larger dose in the evening. In the above example, with a total daily dose of 1,350 mg, generally 450 mg of ESKALITH CR should be given in the morning and 900 mg of ESKALITH CR in the evening. If desired, the total daily dose of 1,350 mg can be given in 3 equal 450-mg doses of ESKALITH CR. 

These patients should be monitored at 1- to 2-week intervals, and dosage adjusted if necessary, until stable and satisfactory serum levels and clinical state are achieved. When patients require closer titration than that available with doses of ESKALITH CR in increments of 450 mg, immediate-release capsules should be used. 

Acute Mania: Optimal patient response to ESKALITH can usually be established and maintained with 1,800 mg per day in divided doses. Such doses will normally produce the desired serum lithium level ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq/L. 

Dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient''s clinical state and serum lithium levels is necessary. Serum levels should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized. 

Long-Term Control: The desirable serum lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 900 mg to 1,200 mg per day in divided doses will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months. 

Patients unusually sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels below 1.0 mEq/L.
N.B.: Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8 to 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis. 

Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by younger patients.');

Although the proponents of biochemic combinations say that it is a seperate system and we can use combinations because there can be a defeciency of more that one cell-salt at a given time, I have some questions which should make people situp and think.
1. How homeopathic Natrum-mur 12x is different from biochemic Natrum-mur 12x?
2. Why is it that Natrum-mur 6c is homeopathic but natrum-mur 12x is biochemic? There is technically speaking not much difference - both are diluted, potentized to nearly same level.
3. When biochemic medicines are also slected on the basis of symptom-similarity, how is it different from the homeopathic law of similia?
Anybody who ponders seriously over such questions would realize that cell-salts are not an independent system. They are very much a part of homeopathy and therefore the laws that apply to homeopathic combinations, should apply to the biochemic combinations too.');

Nexium is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and injury of the esophagus (food pipe between the mouth and stomach). Nexium is used to treat the symptoms of GERD, allow the esophagus to heal, and prevent further damage to the esophagus. It is also used with other medications to prevent stomach ulcers. Nexium is in a class of medications called proton pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.
How Taken
Nexium comes as a delayed-release (long-acting) capsule to take it orally. It is usually taken once a day at least one hour before a meal. To help you remember to take Nexium, take it around the same time every day. Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you cannot swallow the capsule, put one tablespoon of cool, soft applesauce in an empty bowl. Open one Nexium capsule and carefully sprinkle the pellets onto the applesauce. Mix the pellets with the applesauce, and swallow the entire tablespoonful of the applesauce and pellet mixture immediately. Do not chew the pellets in the applesauce. Do not save the pellets and applesauce for later use.
Warnings/Precautions
Before taking Nexium, tell your doctor if you have ever had any type of liver disease. You may not be able to take Nexium, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring.

Pseudo membranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin and amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.
Missed Dose
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take only your next regularly scheduled dose. Do not take a double dose of this medication unless otherwise directed by your doctor.

INSERT INTO `blood_pressure` VALUES('HEP1','AMRIT KALASH ','Nector Tablets','Ayurveda and Health The ayurvedic definition of health goes far beyond “absence of disease.” According to ayurveda, health is that state where mind, body, spirit, emotions and senses are all in perfect balance—the way nature designed them to be. In our high-stress, sleep-deprived, eat-on-the-go, get-it-all-done-yesterday world, having our systems go out of balance is easy. Eventually, imbalances manifest as disease. Popping pills is at best a quick fix for the symptoms. Plus, many modern drugs come with unwanted and often dangerous side effects. Ayurveda maintains that balance is the key to health. Rather than repressing symptoms, ayurveda advocates correcting the underlying imbalance in the physiology for a real solution: much like watering the roots of the plant to obtain healthy growth above the soil. For example, according to ayurveda, allergic reactions generally stem from an impairment of the body''s natural ability to filter out allergens such as pollen and dust due to poor digestion and a build up of toxins within the body. Ayurvedic modalities to correct this imbalance would therefore focus on enhancing the digestion and flushing the toxins out of the body. Ayurveda doesn''t promise instant results. Its approach is gentle and holistic, with not just healing herbs but diet, daily and seasonal routines, and behaviors playing important roles in restoring balance. And ayurveda places the responsibility for your well-being squarely where it belongs—with you. But if you make that commitment to yourself, ayurveda offers rich, cumulative benefits that can help you enjoy a long, healthy, blissful life. Herbal Power Ancient ayurvedic healers knew that herbs were the repositories of the most concentrated form of nature''s intelligence. Researchers today are confirming that herbs contain the richest mixtures of phytochemicals—natural chemicals such as bioflavonoids that offer medicinal and nutritional value. Herbal formulations made with whole herbs, as Maharishi Ayurveda supplements are, work more like foods than like drugs in the body. They offer potent nourishment to the cells and tissues and correct imbalances in the physiology over time, safely, without causing side effects. How quickly you see results from taking herbal formulations depends on your individual physiology. If a person has a high level of accumulated toxins (ama) blocking the channels of the body, the herbs may take longer to work. The diet and daily routine of the person also has a bearing on how quickly and how well herbs work, as also the health goal being addressed. The product flyers and brochures, and our newsletters, offer dietary and lifestyle recommendations that serve to enhance the benefit of the herbs. Focusing on one or two health goals at a time is best. Try and identify the imbalance that came first, and work on correcting that to start with. Sometimes you may find that clearing the original imbalance addresses some secondary imbalances as well. Nutritional supplements work best if they are taken regularly, every day. If you tend to forget to take them, devise ways to remind yourself. Make notes in your daytimer or put post-it notes on your computer. Keep them on your dining table. Carry them with you in a tablet dispenser to work. If you have questions, call us at 800-255-8332 —our knowledgeable health educators are here to help. The Science of Herb Combining Maharishi Ayurveda herbal formulations are blends rather than single herbs or oils. They epitomize the science of herb combining at its sophisticated best. The herbs in our formulas are carefully selected and combined to strengthen the formula in different ways: Primary herbs offer targeted benefits for a specific area of health, such as energy. Supporting herbs reinforce the healing action of the primary herbs. Bioavailability herbs help your body assimilate and use the nutrients. Herbal ''co-factors'' remove impurities and the toxic byproducts of incomplete digestion from your body. Balancing herbs cancel out any potential discomforts or side effects that can come with the benefits of a particular herb. Together these different types of herbs create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. We use whole herbs in our formulas, not isolated ingredients, because we understand that Nature''s healing wisdom is a delicate balance that is preserved in the whole plant, not an isolated chemical. Quality Matters The Haritaki fruit, one of the three components of Digest Tone (Triphala), comes in seven different varieties. While all are beneficial, most deliver only one or two of the many benefits that the texts mention for Haritaki. Only one variety, called Vijaya, offers all of the benefits. And Vijaya is the only variety that is used in Maharishi Ayurveda''s Digest Tone, even though it is harder to obtain and much more expensive. Amla fruit is meticulously processed 21 times in the juice of Amla, exactly as laid down in the ancient texts, to make our ReGen Vitality (Amla-Berry) tablets. This takes time, but the tablets become a potent source of the diverse benefits this divine fruit is said to offer when processed in this manner. It takes over six months of intensive iterative processing to obtain our bhasmas—minerals in a form that can be easily assimilated and used by the body. When herbs are sorted for quality, often over half the batch is rejected due to our strict standards for maturity, purity and potency. Many ayurvedic companies in India sell rejected herbs to smaller companies that use them in their products. We burn rejected herbs so that this does not happen. No shortcuts. No compromises. Maharishi Ayurveda combines authentic formulations obtained from the ancient ayurvedic texts with meticulous processing and state-of-the-art manufacturing to ensure that you get pure, effective, safe herbal formulations. Herbal intelligence Herbs contain the most concentrated form of nature''s intelligence. Our goal is to preserve this natural intelligence through the harvesting and manufacturing processes so that the finished herbal preparations can work effectively at the deepest levels of the physiology. We harvest our own herbs. Herbs naturally vary in potency with seasons, cycles of the moon and even by the time of day. Following traditional harvesting and processing techniques ensures natural standardization of potency. Where possible without threatening the natural ecological balance, our herbs are gathered in the wild, because wild-crafted herbs can be as much as 100 times more potent than their cultivated counterparts. Experts in dravyaguna—plant identification—examine each batch of harvested herbs. It takes great attention and expertise to correctly identify herbs. Each batch of herbs is then sorted for quality. It''s not unusual for over half the crop to be rejected, because ayurvedic standards for maturity, purity and potency are stringent. When the herbs enter the processing plant, they are also examined using HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) to chemically identify them and ensure potency. We use traditional methods of extraction and processing. Extracts are processed using steam distillation, never with alcohol or benzene. We do not expose herbs to high temperatures that can destroy the healing intelligence they possess. None of our formulas are made with heavy metals. Our formulations are all-natural—they contain no artificial colors of flavors or excipients of any kind. Natural binders collected from the wild, such as gum arabic, are the only binders used in some formulas. All capsules are vegetarian, and the coatings on tablets are vegetable glycerin. No animal products are used in the formulas or during processing. Stringent testing Every batch of finished product undergoes a battery of tests at our state-of-the-art processing facility in India. These tests include examination for overall purity, heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury), residual pesticides and biological contamination. When the product arrives in the United States, it is once again subjected to a series of tests by a premier independent analytical laboratory before it is bottled for sale. Quality certifications The Maharishi Ayurveda manufacturing facility in India has earned a number of international quality certifications: ISO 9001 - ISO certification is the international standard for assessing management, testing and manufacturing for production companies. The ISO review targets twenty quality categories including design control, production, storage, inspection and testing procedures. The stringent criteria used to evaluate Maharishi Ayurveda are the same as those used to assess nuclear power plants. GMP - The Good Manufacturing Practices certification is awarded for manufacturing and delivering consistently effective, safe and reliable products batch after batch. An independent panel of experts conducts extensive investigations to verify that the company has established manufacturing systems and practices that ensure error-free, safe and consistently high quality products before this certification is issued. HACCP - Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points requires a close focus on achieving step-by-step process quality at all stages of production identified as critical control points. The objective is to produce and deliver health-hazard free (i.e., clinically safe) products. The Science of Herb Processing The ancient ayurvedic texts maintain that how a formula is prepared is as crucial to its efficacy as what goes into that formula. Ayurvedic herb processing is therefore a meticulous and highly developed science that ranges from instructions on when to harvest a specific herb to the sequence in which ingredients are to be added to a formulation. Our formulas are prepared meticulously as laid down in the ayurvedic texts. Following traditional harvesting and processing techniques ensures natural standardization of potency. We use traditional methods of extraction and processing. No chemical solvents are used in the extraction process, nor are the herbs exposed to high temperatures that can damage their natural intelligence. Different ingredients or components are added to a formulation at the specific times and temperatures detailed in the texts to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the final formulation.');
